Original project was to make endonym country name localisations of OTTO's dynamic shits but it has been slowly shifting toward its own independent naming mod changing more than just localisations
As of now, it's mostly making it more flexible and compatible to other mods while keeping latin writing.

Future Projects includes:
Allow cycling through different writing systems, IE: Phonetics, Romanji, Cyrillic, etc...
Tie pluri-cultural countries' names to cultures' political power

-Flow
